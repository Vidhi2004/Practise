# Practise
I am trying to use Ubuntu on Oracle Virtual Box and tring out shell scripting and Docker

Log Rotation Script:
I have developed a Bash script that automates the rotation and compression of log files based on user-defined criteria.
The script includes features like:
1. Accepting user input for log directory and time threshold.
2. Finding and compressing old log files.
3. Archiving the compressed logs.
4. Handling errors during the operation.

Docker Integration:
I created a Dockerfile to containerize your log rotation script.
I set up a docker-compose.yml file for easy orchestration of your Docker container, which can run the script.

Git Repository:
I maintained version control using Git, with a GitHub repository to showcase my work.
I created branches and merged them, demonstrating good practices in version control.
